UNIVERSITY ADVISING CENTER - DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION CASE STUDY

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
================
The University Advising Center provides academic counseling to students during the fall and spring semesters. The center operates Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Students can either walk in or schedule appointments.

STUDENT ARRIVALS
================
Walk-in Students:
- Arrive according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process
- Monday-Wednesday: Peak hours 11 AM-2 PM at 12 students/hour, otherwise 6 students/hour
- Thursday-Friday: Consistent 8 students/hour throughout the day

Scheduled Appointments:
- 15-minute time slots from 9:00 AM to 4:45 PM
- Appointment slots booked at 80% capacity on average
- Students arrive with normal distribution: mean=scheduled time, std dev=5 minutes

Student Types:
- 60% Freshmen/Sophomores (longer advising sessions)
- 30% Juniors/Seniors (shorter sessions)
- 10% Graduate students (complex advising needs)

RESOURCES
=========
Academic Advisors:
- 3 full-time advisors available
- Advisor 1: Specializes in freshmen (9 AM - 5 PM, Monday-Friday)
- Advisor 2: Specializes in upperclassmen (9 AM - 5 PM, Monday-Wednesday)
- Advisor 3: General advisor (10 AM - 4 PM, Tuesday-Thursday)
- Each advisor takes a 30-minute lunch break (staggered: 12:00, 12:30, 1:00 PM)

Front Desk Staff:
- 2 front desk staff members
- Handle check-in and scheduling
- Available 9 AM - 5 PM daily

Advising Offices:
- 4 private advising offices
- 1 group advising room (capacity: 8 students)

PROCESS FLOW
============

Walk-in Students:
1. Check-in at front desk (2-4 minutes, uniform distribution)
   - Provide student ID
   - Describe advising need
   - If all advisors busy and queue > 10, offered appointment instead

2. Wait for available advisor
   - Freshmen/sophomores preferentially routed to Advisor 1
   - Graduate students routed to any available advisor
   - FIFO within priority groups

3. Advising session
   - Freshmen/Sophomores: Normal(mean=25 min, std dev=8 min)
   - Juniors/Seniors: Normal(mean=15 min, std dev=5 min)
   - Graduate students: Normal(mean=35 min, std dev=10 min)
   - Requires 1 advisor and 1 office

4. Check-out (1-2 minutes, uniform)
   - Schedule follow-up if needed (30% probability)

Appointment Students:
1. Check-in (1-2 minutes, uniform)
   - Verify appointment time
   - Skip queue if on time

2. Advising session (same durations as walk-ins)

3. Check-out (1-2 minutes)

CONSTRAINTS
===========
- Maximum waiting queue: 15 students (fire code)
- Students willing to wait maximum 45 minutes before leaving (balking)
- No walk-ins accepted after 4:30 PM
- Group advising sessions held at 10 AM and 2 PM daily (5-8 students)
- Advisor utilization should not exceed 90% (burnout prevention)

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
======================
Primary Metrics:
- Average wait time for walk-ins < 20 minutes
- 95th percentile wait time < 35 minutes
- Advisor utilization: 65-85% (optimal range)
- Student satisfaction: >90% seen within 30 minutes

Secondary Metrics:
- Percentage of students balking: < 5%
- Appointment no-show rate: 15% (historical average)
- Office utilization
- Peak queue length

WHAT-IF SCENARIOS
=================
Experiment 1: Staffing Changes
- Test impact of adding a 4th advisor
- Evaluate reducing Advisor 2 to part-time (9 AM - 1 PM)
- Assess Saturday hours (9 AM - 1 PM) with 2 advisors

Experiment 2: Process Improvements
- Implement virtual check-in (reduces check-in time to 0.5-1 minute)
- Offer video advising for simple questions (30% of upperclassmen)
- Group advising for common topics (reduces individual session time)

Experiment 3: Scheduling Optimization
- What is the optimal appointment slot duration? (15 min vs 20 min vs 30 min)
- Should we reserve slots for walk-ins?
- Impact of overbooking appointments by 10%

Experiment 4: Demand Analysis
- At what arrival rate does the system break down?
- Effect of finals week (arrival rate doubles)
- Impact of registration period (25% increase in arrivals)

DATA SOURCES
============
Historical Data Available:
- Semester arrival logs (15,000 student visits)
- Advisor session durations (logged in system)
- Student wait times (electronic queue system)

Distributions Fitted from Data:
- Session durations: Normal distributions (parameters above)
- Arrival patterns: Non-homogeneous Poisson (rates above)
- No-show probability: 15% for appointments, 0% for walk-ins

Missing Information:
- Exact lunch break times for advisors (assume staggered)
- Student patience thresholds (assume 45 minutes)
- Video advising adoption rate (pilot program, assume 30%)

ASSUMPTIONS
===========
1. Advisors can handle any student type (though specialization preferred)
2. Office space is not a constraint (4 offices for 3 advisors)
3. No system failures or advisor sick days
4. Students arrive independently (no group arrivals)
5. Session durations independent of wait time experienced
6. Group advising counts as 1 advisor-hour regardless of group size

VALIDATION TARGETS
==================
Model should reproduce these observed statistics:
- Average daily throughput: 55 students
- Peak queue length: 12 students (observed maximum)
- Average advisor utilization: 72%
- Fraction of time all advisors busy: 35%

SIMULATION PARAMETERS
=====================
Warmup Period: 2 weeks (burn-in)
Run Length: 16 weeks (full semester)
Replications: 50 (to achieve confidence intervals within Â±5%)
Random Streams: Separate for arrivals, service times, routing decisions

OUTPUT ANALYSIS
===============
Required Reports:
- Time-series plot of queue length
- Advisor utilization by hour of day
- Wait time distribution (histogram)
- Sensitivity to arrival rate (tornado diagram)

Confidence Intervals:
- 95% CI on mean wait time
- 95% CI on advisor utilization
- 95% CI on balking percentage

DECISION SUPPORT
================
Use simulation to answer:
1. Should we hire a 4th advisor? (cost: $50,000/year, value: reduced wait times)
2. Optimal mix of walk-in vs appointment capacity?
3. Best advisor schedule to minimize overtime while meeting service levels?
4. Early warning system: at what queue length should we call in backup advisor?

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
====================
- Model student types as entity attributes
- Use resource pools for advisors (heterogeneous servers)
- Implement balking as conditional routing based on queue length
- Track warmup period separately from main statistics
- Use common random numbers for comparing scenarios
- Validate model against historical data before making predictions
