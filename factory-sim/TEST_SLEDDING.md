# Snow Tubing Sledding Test - Verification

## Test Objective
Verify that the DES simulation clock advances properly and entities (sledders) flow through the system correctly.

## System Configuration
- **Lift**: 1 resource, capacity 6 (6 lanes going up)
- **Tubing Hill**: 6 resources, capacity 1 each (6 lanes going down)
- **Arrival Rate**: Varies by time of day
- **Process Times**:
  - Lift ride: 5 minutes (deterministic)
  - Tubing ride: 3 minutes (deterministic)

## Expected Behavior
1. ✅ Time advances from 0 to maxSimTime
2. ✅ Entities are created at arrival times
3. ✅ Entities seize Lift resource
4. ✅ Entities process through Lift (5 min)
5. ✅ Entities release Lift and seize Tubing lane
6. ✅ Entities process through Tubing (3 min)
7. ✅ Entities depart system
8. ✅ All entities that entered before maxSimTime complete their journey

## Test Results

**Test Date**: October 13, 2025
**Test File**: `test-des-clock.ts`
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

### Configuration
- **Lift Resource**: 6 person capacity, 5 minute ride up
- **Tubing Lane Resource**: 1 person capacity, 3 minute ride down
- **Arrival Rate**: 0.2 sledders/minute (12 per hour)
- **Simulation Duration**: 60 minutes (with drain period)

### Results
```
Final Time: 70.90 minutes
Total Events Processed: 97
Sledders Created: 17
Sledders Departed: 17
Still in System: 0
Avg Cycle Time: 11.44 min
Throughput: 0.2398 sledders/min
```

### Verification Checks
- ✅ Time advanced to 70.9 min (expected >= 60)
- ✅ Entities created: 17 sledders
- ✅ Entities departed: 17 sledders
- ✅ System fully drained (0 remaining)
- ✅ All entities completed their journey

### Key Findings
1. **Simulation clock works correctly** - Time advanced from T=0 to T=70.9 minutes
2. **Entity flow is working** - All 17 sledders that entered the system completed both lift and tubing rides
3. **System drains properly** - After maxSimTime, the simulation continued until all in-flight entities completed
4. **Average cycle time**: 11.44 minutes (higher than theoretical 8 min due to queueing)
   - Theory: 5 min lift + 3 min tubing = 8 min
   - Actual: 11.44 min includes queue waiting time
5. **Resource contention observed** - The single tubing lane (capacity 1) creates a bottleneck, causing queue buildup

### Progress Timeline
The simulation showed proper time advancement with checkpoints:
- T=10.3 min: 6 arrived, 1 departed
- T=21.0 min: 6 arrived, 5 departed
- T=30.3 min: 7 arrived, 6 departed
- T=40.3 min: 11 arrived, 8 departed
- T=50.1 min: 14 arrived, 10 departed
- T=61.1 min: 17 arrived, 13 departed
- T=70.9 min: 17 arrived, 17 departed (complete drain)

### Conclusion
✅ **All test objectives met!** The DES simulation engine correctly:
1. Advances time from 0 to maxSimTime and beyond (to drain)
2. Creates entities at specified arrival rate
3. Processes entities through resources (lift and tubing lanes)
4. Tracks entity state changes (arrive → seize → process → release → depart)
5. Allows system to fully drain after maxSimTime
