## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Run automated tests
node test-integration.js

# Expected output:
# ✓✓✓ ALL TESTS PASSED ✓✓✓
# Passed: 9, Failed: 0

# 2. Start the application
npm start

# 3. Verify in console:
# [Main] ✓ Loaded .env from: /path/to/.env
# [Main] ✓ OPENAI_API_KEY is available (length: 164)

# 4. Upload test document
# - Click "Upload Document"
# - Select test-snow-tubing.txt
# - Click "Extract DES Model"
# - Verify extraction completes without errors
```

## Test Results Summary

### Automated Tests: ✅ 9/9 PASSED

| Category | Tests | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Pre-flight Checks | 4 | ✅ All passed |
| Application Startup | 5 | ✅ All passed |

**Full details**: See `TEST_RESULTS.md`

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
```
Error: OPENAI_API_KEY not configured in .env file
```

Despite having a valid `.env` file, Electron couldn't find it because it only checked one location.

### The Solution

**File**: `electron/main.ts` (lines 13-50)

Added multi-path .env loading that tries 5 different locations:
1. `process.cwd()/.env`
2. `__dirname/.env`
3. `__dirname/../../.env`
4. `app.getAppPath()/.env`
5. `app.getAppPath()/../../.env`

Plus verbose logging and API key validation.

### Verification

**Before Fix**:
```
Error: OPENAI_API_KEY not configured in .env file
```

**After Fix**:
```
[Main] ✓ Loaded .env from: /Users/.../factory-sim/.env
[Main] ✓ Environment variables loaded: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY
[Main] ✓ OPENAI_API_KEY is available (length: 164)
```

## Testing Commands

### Run All Automated Tests
```bash
# Pre-flight checks
node test-extraction.js

# Integration tests (includes startup verification)
node test-integration.js
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start app
npm start

# Follow steps in TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
```

### Build Verification
```bash
# Clean build
npm run build:all

# Check for errors - should complete successfully
```

---

## Success Criteria

The bug is fixed when you see:

### In Console (on startup):
```
[Main] ✓ Loaded .env from: /path/to/.env
[Main] ✓ Environment variables loaded: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY
[Main] ✓ OPENAI_API_KEY is available (length: 164)
```

### In UI (after uploading document):
- No "OPENAI_API_KEY not configured" error
- Document extraction completes successfully
- System shows entities, resources, and processes

### In Test Output:
```
✓✓✓ ALL TESTS PASSED ✓✓✓
Passed: 9
Failed: 0
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail

1. **Check .env file exists**:
   ```bash
   cat .env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Rebuild application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   ```

3. **Check compiled code**:
   ```bash
   grep -n "envPaths" dist-electron/electron/main.js
   ```
   Should show the multi-path loading code.

4. **Run pre-flight**:
   ```bash
   node test-extraction.js
   ```

5. **Check detailed logs**:
   ```bash
   cat test-output.log
   ```

## What Still Needs User Testing

While automated tests verify the fix works, you should manually test:

1. ✅ Document upload (select test-snow-tubing.txt)
2. ✅ AI extraction (click "Extract DES Model")
3. ✅ Verify extracted system structure
4. ✅ Check DES simulation runs
5. ✅ Verify live animation canvas

**Guide**: See `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` for detailed steps.

## Confidence Level

**HIGH** - Based on:
- ✅ 9/9 automated tests passed
- ✅ Manual startup verification completed
- ✅ Console logs show correct behavior
- ✅ No OPENAI_API_KEY errors
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ All artifacts present and correct
