The Summit Snow Tubing Facility - Operations Description

System Overview:
The Summit is a popular snow tubing facility that operates during winter months. Customers arrive throughout the day to enjoy sliding down snow-covered slopes on inflatable tubes.

Arrival Pattern:
Customer groups arrive at an average rate of 20 groups per hour. Group sizes vary from 1 to 6 people, with most groups having 2-3 members.

Check-in Process:
Upon arrival, customers proceed to the ticket booth where 2 cashiers process check-ins. The check-in process takes approximately 3 minutes per group (with some variation of about 0.8 minutes). During check-in, customers pay, sign waivers, and receive wristbands.

Equipment Distribution:
After checking in, customers walk about 100 feet (taking 30-90 seconds) to the tube distribution area where they pick up their snow tubes. This area can accommodate up to 20 customers at once.

Tow Rope System:
The facility has 8 tow ropes that transport customers up the 500-foot hill. The ride to the top takes exactly 4.5 minutes. Customers grab handles and are pulled to the summit.

Sledding Lanes:
At the top, there are 12 sledding lanes. Customers take between 2.0 and 3.5 minutes to sled down the hill, depending on snow conditions and their weight.

Repeat Behavior:
After reaching the bottom, 75% of customers choose to go again, walking back to the tow rope. The remaining 25% return their tubes and exit the facility.

Peak Hours:
The facility is busiest on weekends from 10 AM to 2 PM.

Performance Goals:
Management wants to minimize wait times, particularly for the tow rope, and maintain an average customer wait time under 5 minutes.
