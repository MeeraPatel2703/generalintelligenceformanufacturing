## How to Use This System

### For Case Study Analysis

```typescript
// 1. Create simulation for your case study
const simulation = new KeyCraftSimulation(168); // 1 week

// 2. Run baseline analysis
const analysisEngine = new AdvancedAnalysisEngine();
const report = analysisEngine.runBaselineAnalysis(10); // 10 replications

// 3. Review bottleneck identification
console.log(report.rootCauseAnalysis.primaryBottleneck);

// 4. Test improvement scenarios
const scenarios = report.recommendedScenarios;
const results = new Map();

for (const scenario of scenarios) {
  const result = analysisEngine.testScenario(scenario, 10);
  results.set(scenario.id, result);
}

// 5. Generate consulting report
const reportGen = new ConsultingReportGenerator();
const consultingReport = reportGen.generateReport(
  'Case Study Name',
  report,
  results
);

## Methodology: Theory of Constraints (TOC)

This system implements **Goldratt's Theory of Constraints**:

### 5-Step Focusing Process

1. **IDENTIFY the constraint**
   → Bottleneck detection via utilization analysis

2. **EXPLOIT the constraint**
   → Ensure bottleneck never starves or works on defects

3. **SUBORDINATE everything else**
   → Don't overproduce at non-bottlenecks

4. **ELEVATE the constraint**
   → Add capacity if exploitation isn't enough

5. **Repeat the process**
   → Find the next constraint

### Key Insights

- **"An hour lost at the bottleneck is an hour lost for the entire system"**
  → Bottleneck determines system throughput

- **"An hour saved at a non-bottleneck is worthless"**
  → Only bottleneck improvements increase throughput

- **"Bottlenecks are not bad - they control flow"**
  → Every system has a constraint; identify and manage it

---

## Financial Analysis Framework

### ROI Metrics Calculated

**Net Present Value (NPV):**
```
NPV = -Investment + Σ(Annual Benefit / (1 + r)^t)
where r = discount rate (12%)
```

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**
```
IRR = rate where NPV = 0
Solved using Newton's method
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Payback = Investment / (Monthly Benefit)
```

### Decision Criteria

| NPV | Payback | Verdict |
|-----|---------|---------|
| > $500k | < 12 mo | ✅✅ Highly Recommended |
| > $100k | < 24 mo | ✅ Recommended |
| > $0 | < 36 mo | ⚠️ Consider |
| < $0 | > 36 mo | ❌ Not Recommended |

## Technical Details

### Simulation Engine

**Event Types:**

- `PROCESS_COMPLETE` - Station finishes processing
- `EQUIPMENT_FAILURE` - Machine breaks down
- `EQUIPMENT_REPAIR` - Machine fixed

**Event Queue:**
- Priority queue sorted by time
- FIFO tie-breaking for simultaneous events
- Efficient O(log n) insertion/removal

**Statistics Collected:**
- Throughput (units/time)
- Lead time (order arrival to completion)
- WIP (average orders in system)
- Utilization (% time busy)
- Queue lengths (average & maximum)
- Quality metrics (scrap, rework rates)

### Analysis Algorithms

**Bottleneck Detection:**
```
For each station:
  Calculate utilization = busy_time / total_time
Bottleneck = station with max(utilization)
```

**Scenario Impact Estimation:**
```
Based on change type:
  - Capacity increase: throughput_multiplier = 1 + (capacity_increase * 0.6)
  - Quality improvement: throughput_multiplier = 1 / (1 - rework_rate_reduction)
  - Automation: reduce processing_time * speed_factor
```

**Financial Calculations:**
```
NPV = -Investment + Σ(Annual_Benefit / (1 + discount_rate)^year)
IRR = solve(NPV = 0) using Newton's method
Payback = Investment / Monthly_Benefit
```
