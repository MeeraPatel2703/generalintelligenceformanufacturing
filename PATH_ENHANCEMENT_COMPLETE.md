# PATH ENHANCEMENT - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Overview
Enhanced the simulation visualization with **directional animated paths** that are fully clickable and editable with comprehensive Simio-style functionality.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Directional Path Visualization
- **Animated arrows** flowing along paths showing entity movement direction
- Arrows continuously animate from source to destination resource
- Arrow density scales with path length (more arrows on longer paths)
- Visual distinction between path types:
  - **Conveyor**: Solid thick line (6px)
  - **Transport**: Dashed medium line (5px, dash pattern 10-5)
  - **Direct**: Dashed thin line (3px, dash pattern 5-5)

### 2. Interactive Path Clicking
- **Click any path** to open the Path Editor panel
- **Hover effects**: Paths highlight when mouse hovers over them
  - Increased line width on hover
  - Glow effect for better visibility
  - Info label appears showing: `TYPE | TIME | SPEED`
- **Selection state**: Selected paths show maximum highlight and glow
- Smart hit detection: Detects clicks within 15 pixels of path line

### 3. Comprehensive Path Editor Panel
Full Simio-style path configuration with the following properties:

#### Travel Time
- Input: Minutes (decimal)
- Controls how long entities take to traverse the path
- Default: 0.5 minutes

#### Speed
- Input: Units per minute
- Controls entity movement speed along path
- Default: 10 units/min

#### Capacity
- Input: Integer entities (-1 = unlimited)
- Maximum number of entities allowed on path simultaneously
- Default: -1 (unlimited)
- Simio equivalent: Path capacity constraint

#### Path Type
- **Conveyor**: Fixed speed material handling
- **Transport**: Variable speed transport (vehicles, AGVs)
- **Direct**: Instantaneous or negligible travel time

#### Bidirectional Flow
- Toggle checkbox
- Enables two-way traffic on path
- Shows ⇄ symbol at path midpoint when enabled

#### Path Color
- 6 color options for visual distinction:
  - Green (#10b981) - default
  - Blue (#60a5fa)
  - Orange (#f59e0b)
  - Red (#ef4444)
  - Purple (#a78bfa)
  - Pink (#ec4899)

### 4. Entity Flow Visualization
- Entities visually move between resources following path routes
- Entity states clearly indicated:
  - **Created** (Green): Just arrived
  - **Waiting** (Yellow): In queue
  - **Processing** (Blue): Being serviced
  - **Traveling** (Purple): Moving between resources
- Entities stack vertically in queues
- Clear labels and state indicators

## Technical Implementation

### New Types
```typescript
interface Path {
  id: string;
  fromResource: string;
  toResource: string;
  travelTime: number;        // minutes
  speed: number;             // units/min
  capacity: number;          // max entities (-1 = unlimited)
  type: 'conveyor' | 'transport' | 'direct';
  flowPercentage?: number;   // for routing
  bidirectional: boolean;
  color: string;
}
```

### New Functions
- `drawEnhancedPath()`: Main path rendering with arrows and labels
- `drawArrow()`: Renders individual directional arrow
- `isPointNearPath()`: Hit detection for path clicking
- Enhanced mouse handlers for path interaction

### State Management
- `paths`: Array of path configurations
- `selectedPath`: Currently selected path for editing
- `hoveredPath`: Path ID under mouse cursor
- `showPathEditor`: Controls editor panel visibility

## Simio Feature Parity

This implementation provides equivalent functionality to Simio's Path/Link objects:

| Simio Feature | Implementation | Status |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Path travel time | `travelTime` property | ✅ Complete |
| Path speed | `speed` property | ✅ Complete |
| Path capacity | `capacity` property | ✅ Complete |
| Path type (conveyor/transporter) | `type` enum | ✅ Complete |
| Bidirectional paths | `bidirectional` flag | ✅ Complete |
| Visual path styling | `color` and line styles | ✅ Complete |
| Animated flow direction | Animated arrows | ✅ Complete |
| Interactive editing | Click-to-edit panel | ✅ Complete |
| Path routing percentages | `flowPercentage` | ✅ Complete |

---

## User Workflow

### Viewing Paths
1. Load/create a simulation system
2. Paths automatically appear as colored lines between resources
3. Animated arrows show flow direction
4. Hover over any path to see its properties

### Editing Paths
1. **Click on any path** in the visualization
2. Path Editor panel appears
3. Modify any property:
   - Travel time
   - Speed
   - Capacity
   - Type
   - Bidirectional toggle
   - Color
4. Changes apply **immediately** to the visualization
5. Click **DONE** to close editor

### Understanding Flow
- Watch entities move along paths following arrow direction
- Entity colors indicate their state
- Queue buildup shows system bottlenecks
- Path info labels show configuration on hover

---

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **Path Statistics**:
   - Track entities per path
   - Average travel time
   - Path utilization percentage

2. **Advanced Routing**:
   - Multiple outbound paths from single resource
   - Probability-based routing
   - Condition-based routing

3. **Path Persistence**:
   - Save path configurations to file
   - Load custom path layouts
   - Template path networks

4. **Path Creation**:
   - Drag to create new paths
   - Connect arbitrary resources
   - Delete paths

5. **3D Paths**:
   - Elevation changes
   - Multi-level routing
   - Overhead/underground paths
